## A little about me

1. My name is Nick Sheppard and I am a student and MU.
2. I have a lot of hobbies outside of being on my computer all the time and I need to stay active to keep my mind healthy.
3. Listed below are things I enjoy doing outside of school work.
- Disc golf: one of my biggest passions
- Skating: inline and longboarding through downtown and campus are some of my favorite summer night activities
- Cycling: this comes second to disc golf. I wasn't very active as a child but as I grew older I learned how intensely fun it is to push your body to it's limit.
