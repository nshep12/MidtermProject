I spent a bunch of wasted time in my early 20s messing around with the idea of college, took a few semesters and just wasn't serious. Sure as fire 
cost me a lot of money though. Private school tuition is no joke.

Later in life I decided I had enough of working sales and retail and wanted more for myself. (To be honest, though, I have a couple friends who just passed 200k/yr
at their programming jobs >:D) I decided to do some cheap classes, gauge my motivation, and see if I was truly and finally ready for higher education.

It was during my time in community college that I really started to gain traction on my life and where I am headed. Now, my first semester at MU, I am absolutely 
crusing on life and my future has never been brighter.
