## Some other thoughts

**[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** has become one of my favorite resources in learning how to design and write code. Some of the things I see on there make 
me realize just how little I know on the subject. I am constantly humbled by how much this information builds on itself. As I learn and understand more of what 
is asked of this field, I get more and more excited for the future. I struggled more than I care to admit through life and software is a means to make the biggest 
difference I can in my future. 
I *love* the comfort that brings.
